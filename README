This is an application which allows the SD card inserted into the Pi to be copied to one in a connected USB reader.

To build, run autogen.sh, then ./configure and make.

To generate a Debian package for piclone:
1/ run dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc
2/ install the deb package with sudo dpkg -i piclone_0.?_armhf.deb 


You can also create a dump image of a SDcard on a USB hard drive for archive

1/ create an empty file on your harddrive about the size of your SD card (for example 32GB)

	cd /mnt/myharddrive
	dd if=/dev/zero of=PicloneSAVE_YYYY_MM_DD.bin bs=100M count=320

2/ attach the file to a loopback device (example "/dev/loop0")

	sudo losetup /dev/loop0 PicloneSAVE_YYYY_MM_DD.bin

3/ use piclone with /dev/loop0 as target

4/ detach loop device 

	sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0

5/ you can use md5sum / sha1sum / sha256sum on the file PicloneSAVE_YYYY_MM_DD.bin as usual

6/ you can zip the image using 7zip or another compression tool
